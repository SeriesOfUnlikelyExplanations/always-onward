In this guide, I will give you some tips and details on Mining Painite, Giving you the best spot to mine, etc

At the moment, Painite is one of the best resources you can mine, without looking for Core asteroids. At average, you can sell Painite for 122,749, and with a maximum sell at 797,150 per canister. In one run, I was able to make atleast 156M credits.

For any questions, leave a comment down below and I will address your questions. Also, dont forget to rate the guide if it helped you alot! Happy Hunting Commanders! o7

If you're in desperate need for credits, read this. If you want to do this cause you're bored, feel free to skip this portion

I will not be held liable if you:

+Raided by greedy butt-pirates wanting your valuable space rocks
+Get blown up cause you hit an asteroid
+Get stuck out in a system with no fuel scoopable stars
+Get interdicted while transporting your valuables back to a station where you're going to be selling
them.
+Forget your limpets
What you'll need.
For starters, I recommend you get something close to the Type-9 or that said ship. If you're reading this and you've got an Anaconda but want more credits, knock yourselves out.

1.For Hardpoints, you'll need a mining laser. I recommend you get a 2D fixed Mining laser and fit
atleast 3 of them on your ship. The more lasers firing at the rock, the more Painite it's gonna cry.


2. For Core internals, I can recommend getting A power plant, distributor, thrusters. Power plant and
distributor for better weapons and engine capacity and thrusters for better maneuverability around
asteroids (or even escaping bandits trying to steal your resource)

3. For Optional Internals, you'll need a Refinery, atleast 2 or 3 collector limpet modules, a prospector
limpet controller, detailed surface scanner and more than 200 cargo space. For the refinery, you
choose what you want to get. The more collector limpet controllers you have means you'll be
collecting the resource you mined faster. The prospector limpet so you can scan asteroids and find
that good rock with that sweet Painite. A detailed surface scanner so you can locate the double
hotspots within the ring, and more than 200 cargo space so you have more room for limpets and
so you have alot of storage for your Painite. The More Painite, the better. If you're limited to what
you can carry cause your interstellar backpack is the size of a sling bag (AKA. Your Cargo Hold),
You can get away with 64 being the lowest i'd recommend so you can buy yourself a duffel bag for
your ship.

Oh... And don't forget your limpets. You'll need them. Trust me.
The best spot to Mine Painite
In my experience mining Painite, the best spot I can give is Omicron Capricorni B B1 Ring. There are other places where to Mine Painite. I recommend you check out this link to find the nearest system to you with the double hotspots. http://edtools.ddns.net/miner This tool tells you where the double hotspot is, best place to sell, etc.

Regarding the double hotspot in Omicron Capricorni B, there is a bug where it doesnt show the hotspot after scanning the Ring.


The image above shows you where is the best spot within the double hotspot to mine. Just simply fly in and you'll be finding Painite everywhere you go.

Note: You'll occasionally be scanned by either the feds, or pirates. But fear not, my fellow miner. If a pirate gets on your tail, the feds will blow him up so hard he'll think he got slapped in the ass by Raxxlans. Uusally, They're just eagles scanning you. Don't underestimate those little buggers.
What type of rock you're looking for.
When you're looking for that sweet Painite, look for rocks with 38% or more Painite. It's alright if you see 1 or 2 other resources, just add them to your ignore list since it'll be the Painite that will be putting the bread on the table, and when I mean bread, I mean a loaf of bread the size of an Anaconda.

These rocks can come in all sorts of sizes, variations, etc. Keep this in mind. Be patient. No one got rich in 5 minutes. well, you'll "somewhat" be rich in 4 or less if you're lucky to stumble upon one when first entering the ring.

Tip: When mining your floating space banks, always fly towards the planet so you don't waste you time prospecting on a rock you already checked.
FAQ (As if I get any)
Q: How long have you been mining Painite?
A: for as long as it took me to get my Anaconda (Roughly and hour) ;)

Q: Why can't I see the hot spots on the ring you mentioned in your guide?
A: The Gods don't want you to be swimming in credits. That's why I provided a picture on where to land in the ring

Q: Will I be able to pimp my Sidewinder?
A: absolutely but, why would you?

Q: What are the shapes of the rock i'm looking for?
A: Look for the ones that look like a Liver, a Kidney stone, a large kidney stone and a turd.

Q: How many limpets do you usually bring with you?
A: I bring 180

Q: Is this method legit and not some joke like the "Free Anaconda at Hutton Orbital"?
A: If I was joking I would've said the planet was Raxxla or wouldn't have made the guide in the first place.

Q:Why Painite if you can just mine opals or Low Temp Diamonds?
A: This guide is aimed towards players who don't have the necessary credits to buy them seismic America cannons and abrasion lasers. plus, all you need is a mining laser.
